  # Welcome to LalopathyAI
 
Lalopathy is the playground book project that I prepared is an interactive voice recorded by the user and try to detect speech disorder. It is also a tutorial playground book that explains what Lalopathy is step by step.
 
 
 Please wait for a few seconds for the playground book to start, and then, enjoy!üòÄ
 
 
  - Important:
    Please run 'live view' at full-screen size.

 ## What is Lalopathy? ü§î
 
 ‚ÄúThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) officially defines Lalopathy as ‚Äúa communication disorder such as stuttering, impaired articulation, a language impairment, or a voice impairment that adversely affects a child‚Äôs educational performance.‚Äù Each point within this official definition represents a speech and language subcategory. ‚ÄúA communication disorder such as stuttering‚Äù provides an example of a fluency disorder; other fluency issues include unusual word repetition and hesitant speech. ‚Äù

 ## Design ‚ú®
 
  I designed this playground book by blending my imagination and the design of the Ô£øWWDC20. The result was a very simple, stylish, and easy-to-understand playground book project.

 ## Technologies üßë‚Äçüíª
 
 This playground book was made using the latest technologies such as SwiftUI, CoreML, CreateML, Combine. Thus, I was able to make a playground book project, the infrastructure of which is equipped with the most powerful technologies and compatible with future innovations.

 ## Creating and Training The Model üë©‚Äçüè´
 
 The machine learning model used in this playground book was trained by me using 80 different sounds. I recorded these 80 different sounds with iPhone using AirPods.
