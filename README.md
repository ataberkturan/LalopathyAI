# What's LalopathyAI?

LalopathyAI is the playground book project that I prepared is an interactive voice recorded by the user and try to detect speech disorder. It is also a tutorial playground book that explains what Lalopathy is step by step.

 # Design ✨
 
  I designed this playground book by blending my imagination and the design of the WWDC20. The result was a very simple, stylish, and easy-to-understand playground book project.
 
 # Technologies 🧑‍💻
 
 This playground book was made using the latest technologies such as SwiftUI, CoreML, CreateML, Combine. Thus, I was able to make a playground book project, the infrastructure of which is equipped with the most powerful technologies and compatible with future innovations.
 
 # Creating and Training The Model 👩‍🏫
 
 The machine learning model used in this playground book was trained by me using 80 different sounds. I recorded these 80 different sounds with iPhone using AirPods.
